### Hello there! 👋

My name is Anjad 🥸. I am originally from Syria but I think of myself as a "citizen of the world" as Diogenes once said. I've been living in the Netherlands 🇳🇱 since 2014.

I've always been interested in technology, especially its creative side. In April 2021 I quit my job as project manager in a tech startup and enrolled in a full time, 11 weeks long, intensive web development bootcamp at [Codaisseur](https://codaisseur.com/courses/academy/) in an attempt of a career switch. This experience has been a massive milestone in my path of self-discovery . During the course and since then I've been Waking up every morning wanting to code something new, to dive deeper in a technology, or to learn a new one, and I am hoping this attitude never ceases to exist.
